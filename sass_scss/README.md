Overview
The “Sass & Scss” project focuses on understanding and using Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and Scss (Sass with CSS syntax). By the end of this project, you’ll be able to explain the differences between Sass and Scss, declare variables, use nested definitions, import Sass files, and apply mixins and inheritance styles.
